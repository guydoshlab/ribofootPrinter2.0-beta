# Input file for posavg.
# Place input under each input param below:
#
#
 
# Put in motif, ie H or AAA (nt or aa). This can be a comma-separated list, for example ATG,CTG
# Put all to do all codons or amino acids. Note this will also generate peak (pause) scores, using a hardcoded window of +/-1 nt.
# Put f or l at start of a motif (nt only) to get the first or last such motif in the region of interest (note ALL frames are checked).
INPUT_motif
all
 
# kind is whether the motif is an amino acid (1) or nucleotide sequence (0)
INPUT_kind
1
 
# frame is frame 0, 1, or 2 to be looking in. Put 3 for all 3 frames together.
INPUT_frame
0
 
# Note that this is the minimal rpkm counts within the bkndwindow to be included in the average.
INPUT_bkndwindowthresh
0
 
# This is the size of the half-window around the codon of interest to be included in the average.
INPUT_bkndwindow
30
 
#ORFnorm will normalize to the ORF for UTRs. 0 does not normalize. A positive value will ORF normalize and specify the rpkm ORF threshold for genes to include. This uses a hard-coded shift of +/-13.
INPUT_ORFnorm
0
 
INPUT_shift
12
 
#UTRmode is whether doing UTR5,CDS,or UTR3 = 0,1,2, respectively.
INPUT_UTRmode
1

# Excel file with column of genes you want in the average; if not needed, put none

# rocc file that contains the read alignment and sequence data
