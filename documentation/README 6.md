# Step by step guide on how to run the *posavg* Python script
This Python script takes a ROCC file and averages ribosome profiling data around any sequence feature of interest or computes a pause score for every occurrence of all 61 codons or 20 amino acids. ROCC files are generated from SAM files [here](https://github.com/kyrakerkhofs/mammalian_builddense_edits).

## Run script in terminal
The script is run in the terminal by calling python and providing the python script and settings as described below. An overview of the different settings is in Table format below.

This code generates posavg for all amino acids in the main frame for the CDS:
```unix
python posavg.py "../80S_subset.rocc" "all" 1 0 0 30 0 12 1 â€œnone" "80S_posavg_all_aa_CDS_frame0" > 80S_posavg_all_aa _metadata.txt 
```
